Watchdog Action that sends a SIGABRT to kill the process.
=========================================================

.. _extension_envoy.watchdog.abort_action:


This extension may be referenced by the qualified name *envoy.watchdog.abort_action*

.. note::
  This extension is functional but has not had substantial production burn time, use only with this caveat.

  This extension does not operate on the data plane and hence is intended to be robust against untrusted traffic.

.. warning::
   This API is work-in-progress and is subject to breaking changes.



A GuardDogAction that will terminate the process by sending SIGABRT to the
stuck thread. This would allow easier access to the call stack of the stuck
thread since we would run signal handlers on that thread. This would be
more useful than the default watchdog kill behaviors since those PANIC
from the watchdog's thread.
